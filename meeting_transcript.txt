Meeting Title: Marketing Strategy Q2 2025

Janet (Chair): Good morning everyone, welcome to our Q2 marketing strategy meeting. Today we'll be discussing our upcoming product launch, budget allocation, and social media campaign. Let's start with attendance.

Michael: Michael from Product Development, present.

Sarah: Sarah from Social Media, present.

David: David from Finance, present.

Janet: Great. The agenda for today's meeting is as follows:
1. Review Q1 performance
2. Product launch timeline for Q2
3. Budget allocation
4. Social media strategy
5. Action items assignment

Let's start with the Q1 performance review. David, can you walk us through the numbers?

David: Certainly. Our Q1 marketing spend was 15% under budget while delivering a 22% increase in lead generation compared to the same period last year. The digital marketing campaigns performed particularly well, with a 35% increase in click-through rates and a 28% increase in conversions.

Janet: That's excellent news. Any recommendations based on this data?

David: Based on these metrics, I suggest we increase our budget allocation for digital marketing in Q2, with a focus on the channels that drove the most conversions: email marketing and social media ads.

Janet: Thank you, David. Moving on to the product launch timeline. Michael, can you update us?

Michael: The new product development is on schedule. We're ready for the soft launch in mid-May and the full launch by early June. The team has finalized all the feature sets and the QA process has started.

Janet: Any potential delays or risks we should be aware of?

Michael: There's a slight risk with the supplier for packaging materials, but we're working on a backup solution to mitigate that risk.

Janet: Please keep us updated on that. Sarah, what's your plan for the social media campaign?

Sarah: I've outlined a comprehensive social media strategy for the product launch. It includes a 4-week teaser campaign starting in late April, influencer partnerships, and a hashtag challenge to create buzz before the official launch.

Janet: That sounds promising. What kind of budget do you need?

Sarah: I'm estimating about $25,000 for the entire campaign, including influencer payments and ad spend.

David: That aligns with our Q2 budget projections. I can allocate that amount.

Janet: Perfect. Let's make the following decisions:
1. Increase digital marketing budget by 20% for Q2
2. Approve Sarah's social media campaign with a $25,000 budget
3. Set the final product launch date for June 5th

For action items:
1. Michael to confirm the packaging solution by next Friday
2. Sarah to finalize influencer contracts by the end of the month
3. David to prepare a detailed budget breakdown for the next meeting
4. I'll schedule a follow-up meeting for May 10th to review progress

Any questions or additional points before we conclude?

Michael: All clear from my side.

Sarah: No questions here.

David: Everything is clear.

Janet: Excellent. Thank you all for your time and contributions. Looking forward to a successful product launch in Q2. Meeting adjourned.
